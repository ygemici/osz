OS/Z Boot Process
=================

Loader
------

OS/Z uses the [BOOTBOOT](https://github.com/bztsrc/bootboot) protocol to get the system running.
The compatible [loader](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/tree/master/loader) is loaded by the firmware as the last step of POST.
On every platforms, the loader initializes the hardware (including the framebuffer), loads initrd and locates `sys/core` inside.
When found, it maps that at the top of the address space (-2M..0) and passes control to it.

Core
----

First of all we have to clearify that `core` consist of two parts: one is platform independent, the other part is
architecture and platform specific (see [porting](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/docs/porting.md)).
During boot, the execution is jumping forth and back from one part to the another.

The entry point that the loader calls is `_start`, which can be found in [src/core/(platform)/start.S](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/x86_64/start.S).
It disables interrupts, sets up segments registers, stack frame and checks required CPU features. It also initializes [kprintf](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/kprintf.c), so that it can call kpanic if needed.
Finally jumps to the C startup code `main()` in [src/core/main.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/main.c) which is a platform independent code.

That platform independent `main()` does the following:

 1. as OS/Z is polite, greets you with a "OS/Z starting..." message, then
 2. `env_init` parses the [environment variables](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/docs/bootopts.md) in [src/core/env.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/env.c) passed by the loader.
 3. `pmm_init()` sets up Physical Memory Manager in [src/core/pmm.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/pmm.c).
 4. `sys_init()` initializes [system services](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/docs/services.md), in [src/core/(platform)/sys.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/x86_64/sys.c), which loads `idle` task
 and enumerates system buses to locate and load [device drivers](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/docs/drivers.md). It will also initialize
the [IRQ Routing Table](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/x86_64/isr.c#L121) (IRT).
 5. second service is the file system service, `service_init(SRV_FS)` in [src/core/service.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/service.c) which is a normal system service, except it has the initrd entirely mapped in in it's bss.
 6. user interface is initialized with `service_init(SRV_UI)` in [src/core/service.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/service.c). These first three services (aka `idle`, `FS`, `UI`) are mandatory, unlike the rest.
 7. loads additional, non-critical tasks by several `service_init()` calls in [src/core/service.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/service.c) like the `syslog`, `inet`, `sound` and `init` system services.
 8. drops supervisor privileges by calling `sys_enable()` in [src/core/(platform)/sys.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/x86_64/sys.c).

That function switches to the first task, and then the scheduler, `sched_pick` in [src/core/sched.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/sched.c)
chooses driver and service tasks one by one until all of them blocks. Note that pre-emption is not enabled at this point.
Driver tasks perform hardware initialization and they fill up the IRT.

When the `idle` task first scheduled, it will call `sys_ready()` in [src/core/(platform)/sys.c](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/x86_64/sys.c), which
 1. enables IRQs with entries in IRT. It also enables timer IRQ and with that pre-emption may begin.
 2. finally sends a SYS_mountfs message to "FS" task in the name of "init" task.

The control is passed to ["FS" task](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/fs/main.c), which receives the
SYS_mountfs message and parses [fstab](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/etc/sys/etc/fstab).
When mounting finished, it notifies the ["init" task](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/init/main.c) and
normal operation begins.

(NOTE: If OS/Z was compiled with debug support and `debug=tests` passed in [environment](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/etc/sys/config),
then `core` loads [system test](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/test/main.c) instead of `sys/init`,
which will perform various unit and functionality tests.)

User land
---------

The first real 100% userspace process is started by the [init](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/init/main.c) system service.
If rescueshell was requested in [environment](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/etc/sys/config), then init
starts [bin/sh](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/sh/main.c). If it is the first run, then starts `bin/identity`
to query computer identity such as hostname from the user. Finally starts all user servies. User services are classic
UNIX daemons, among others the user session service that provides a login prompt.

End game
--------

When the `init` system service quits, the execution is [passed back](https://github.com/bztsrc/osz/blob/master/src/core/msg.c#L180) to `core`.
Then OS/Z says 'Good Bye' with `kprintf_reboot()` or with `kprintf_poweroff()` (depending on the exit status), and the platform
dependent part restarts or turns off the computer.
